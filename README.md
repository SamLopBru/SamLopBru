## 🚀 ML Projects

- [🧪 ML Model Comparison for Tabular Data](https://github.com/SamLopBru/FirstMLProject.git)  
  First machine learning project exploring different approaches for data cleaning and comparing model performance across various algorithms.

- [🔬 Tissue Classification in Histological Colorectal Images](https://github.com/SamLopBru/ColorrectalDL.git)
  Built a deep learning pipeline to classify 8 tissue types in colorectal histology images using VGG19, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. Achieved 94.2% accuracy with fine-tuned VGG19 and implemented sliding window inference for full-image segmentation.
- [🎓 Final Degree Project: Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning](https://github.com/SamLopBru/FinalDegreeProject.git)  
  Developed a CNN with slice-level attention for early breast cancer detection in tomosynthesis images, reducing the computational cost of training.
